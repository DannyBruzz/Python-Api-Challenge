# Python-Api-Challenge
Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to analyse data and making observations. 
Observation #1: There seems to be a moderate positive correlation between the latitude and maximum temperature of cities in the Southern Hemisphere, with the r-squared value being 0.61. The positive correlation is weaker for Norther Hemisphere cities, with the r-squared value being 0.39. 

Observation #2: There seems to be miniscule correlation between the latitude of a city and the cloudiness, as seen in the tiny r-squared values for both Northern and Southern hemispheres. 

Observation #3: Windspeed seems to be evenly spread against the latitudes of the cities, as seen in the City Latitude vs Wind speed figure.
